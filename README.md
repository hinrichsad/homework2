# homework2
I owuld like this to work as a barebones skeleton of the portfolio I will eventually use. Obviously I need to update it to have real text and links with working icons, and I definitely need a small splash of color but I am not too sure how I would like to impliment that as of yet. I would like to continue messing with a background until I find one that is both professional and eye catching, so that may take a bit to find the right thing. That being said the nav bar is functional and the elements should be responsive.
